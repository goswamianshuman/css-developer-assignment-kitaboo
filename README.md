## 2. HTML Structure and Explanation

The HTML file is structured to ensure readability, accessibility, and maintainability.

### 2.1 Navigation Bar

- Implemented using the `<nav>` tag with `role="navigation"` for accessibility.
- Provides links to key sections: Home, Features, Pricing, and Contact.
- Uses Flexbox for alignment, ensuring a responsive layout.

### 2.2 Hero Section

- Contains a visually appealing heading, an image, and a call-to-action (CTA) button.
- The CTA button encourages user engagement and is styled for hover effects.

### 2.3 Pricing Table

- Built using a semantic `<section>` with three tiers: Basic, Standard, and Premium.
- Uses CSS Grid for layout, ensuring a dynamic and flexible design.

### 2.4 Contact Form

- Consists of Name, Email, and Message fields, enclosed in `<form>`.
- Accessibility enhanced with `<label>` elements and `aria-required` attributes.
- Utilizes form validation to ensure a user-friendly experience.

### 2.5 Footer Section

- Placed within the `<footer>` tag, serving as the page's concluding content.
- Includes copyright information and social media links.

## 3. CSS Implementation

### 3.1 Responsive Layout

- CSS Grid and Flexbox ensure that elements adjust dynamically to different screen sizes.
- Media queries in `media-queries.css` provide additional responsiveness.

### 3.2 Smooth Scrolling and Sticky Navigation

- `scroll-behavior: smooth;` is applied to enhance user experience when navigating sections.
- The navigation bar remains fixed at the top for easy access.

### 3.3 Loading Animation

- The preloader animation is handled in `animation.css` using `@keyframes fadeOut`.
- A spinner effect (`@keyframes spin`) adds a professional touch to page loading.

## 4. Accessibility Enhancements

- ARIA roles like `role="banner"` and `role="navigation"` improve screen reader compatibility.
- A **skip-to-content** link is provided for better keyboard navigation.
- Form elements have `aria-required` attributes and labels for clarity.

## 5. MathML & Image Fallback

- The quadratic formula is displayed using MathML (`<math>` and `<mfrac>` tags).
- The logo is implemented using `<picture>`, ensuring an SVG-first approach with PNG fallback.

## Conclusion

The project successfully implements modern HTML and CSS best practices, ensuring accessibility, responsiveness, and a visually appealing user experience. The structured approach makes it maintainable and scalable for future enhancements.
